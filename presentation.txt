We are the team demonic non-deterministcs

We developed a web application that answers the JP Morgan challenge, and the challenge from Microsoft

Our web app scrapes real time data from twitter,
        and analyze using keywords analysis as well as the sentiment analysis provided by Microsoft Azure

We selects the twitter posts that indicate that someone is in danger,
        and then group them according to geological metadata in the posts

Using the geological metadata, we identify all the districts/areas that is potentially in danger,
        and we estimate the number of people in danger by considering the population count in that area,
        as well as the number of tweets that indicate danger sent from that area

Using these identified regions in danger, and given as input a list of centers where responders are located,
        we developed an algorithm that assigns responders to regions in danger. The algorithm optimizes the efficiency of
        saving people by minimizing the ratio of (population reached by responders)/(distance traveled by responders).
